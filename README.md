# Workday-Planner

Here we have a workday planner app that will allow you to create a schedule for your work day!

The current date will display at the top of the page and there are slots labled by their times from 9 am - 5 pm. If the timeslot is in the past, the text area will appear gray. If the timeslot is in the future, the text area will appear green. If the timeslot is the current hour, the text area will appear pink. You will be able to type notes in each slot and save them to the app. When you refresh the page, the text will save in itâ€™s correct timeslot.
